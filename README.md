# Aidea
## an open-source AI platform made in React

Aidea is an open-source AI platform made in React Native and Expo, made especifically for Android and iOS devices.

I made this project as my final school project called PAP (Projeto de Aptidão Profissional, Professional Aptitude Project).

a chat-like interface for text-to-text generation based on OpenAI's API;
