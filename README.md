# Aidea
# an open-source AI user-interface with a focus on mobile

Aidea is an open-source AI mobile interface made in React Native and Expo.

I made this project as my final school project (Projeto de Aptidão Profissional, Professional Aptitude Project).

## Functionality

Aidea boasts a number of AI-based functionalities:

a chat-like interface for text-to-text generation based on OpenAI's API;
a text-to-image generation page based on the StabilityAI API;
a screen for saving and configuring your API keys;
